# Specification Quality Checklist: Module 4 — Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Content Quality | PASS | Focused on student learning outcomes, VLA concepts explained |
| Requirements | PASS | 15 functional requirements, all testable |
| Success Criteria | PASS | 8 measurable outcomes with time metrics |
| User Stories | PASS | 4 prioritized stories with acceptance scenarios |
| Scope | PASS | Clear in/out of scope boundaries defined |

## Notes

- Spec is complete and ready for `/sp.plan`
- All items pass validation - no clarifications needed
- User stories map clearly to chapter structure (VLA → Whisper → LLM Planning → Capstone → Future)
- Dependencies on Modules 1, 2, and 3 are documented
- Supports both local (Ollama) and cloud LLM options for accessibility
- Pre-recorded audio files assumption addresses students without microphones
